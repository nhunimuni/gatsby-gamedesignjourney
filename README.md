# Uni Project (Media Programming: Web Technologies)

Our lecturer wanted to introduce us to the idea of static site generators for a way to publish - well, mostly static - content on the web. This assignment is about doing this at least once with any project of our your choice.

Thus I used this opportunity to create a sort of diary about the course „Game Design and Interaction“. This static webpage will record topics, which we covered at the beginning of the course.

I chose [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). The reason for choosing GatsbyJS is simply because it is based on ReactJS and that suited my interests at that time. Furthermore, i used the [Novela Gatsby Theme](https://github.com/narative/gatsby-theme-novela).
