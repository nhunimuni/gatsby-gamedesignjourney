## Animal Crossing: New Horizon explained to an asshole.

Animal Crossing: New Horizon is a real-time life simulation game from Nintendo's Animal Crossing series. Together with animal neighbours, you become the inhabitants of a previously unspoilt island. You are the representative of your own island and can control the direction of rivers and heights of elevations, among other things, and thus shape the island as you wish. Use the natural resources of the island, create objects and turn the island into a modern city or even a small idyllic farming village with a spa center right on the beach? Together with the inhabitants and friends you will experience how the island changes over the year.
